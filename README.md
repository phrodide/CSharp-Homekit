# CSharp-Homekit
Apple Homekit implementation in pure C#. No unsafe or external dependencies.

Made with .NET 5, now targeting .NET 6. I made this on a Windows PC but should be easy to port to other OSes. See Program.cs for my notes.

While this is not a dead project, I've decided to make it public to see how others like it. I'm currently focusing on other projects.
